# Crayons
I am excited to share that my streak of learning is still going at freeCodeCamp! Today I learned CSS colors , many different properties and shorthand properties for adding shadows, opacities and color blends. It was quite interesting to see how color contrast can be distracting if it's overused on a website, and can make text hard to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. Overall, this course taught me that It's a better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page..
